//! Turbomachinery component models.
//!
//! This module provides component-level models for devices like compressors and turbines.
//! Outputs are designed to be unambiguous for systems modeling. For example,
//! turbomachinery work is reported as a non-negative work type (e.g., [`CompressionWork`]),
//! rather than a signed value with a convention-dependent meaning.
